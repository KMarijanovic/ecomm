This project is all about learning JavaScrip through "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course (2022)" by Colt Steele & Stephen Grider, making an e-commerce app. Here I learned how to set up public pages for users, and hidden ones for administration. This project doesn't have BUY function but it has SHOPPING CART. Also, this is the first time learning about npm and installing different dependencies like express and nodemon. First time creating a web server, learning about middlewares, managing cookies, protecting passwords, signing in/up/out, understanding validation logic, and much more... This app is not for real commercial use because this project is only for practice of JS and creating Data Store on our local hard drive (if there were more "servers" everyone would have different outcome of informations).
